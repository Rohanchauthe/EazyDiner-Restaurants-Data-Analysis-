EazyDiner Restaurants Data Analysis
Web Scraping & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on scraping real-world restaurant data from EazyDiner and performing data cleaning, transformation, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights related to restaurant ratings, pricing, locations, and customer preferences.
The goal is to convert raw, unstructured web data into meaningful, actionable insights that can support data-driven decision-making in the food and hospitality domain.

🎯 Project Objectives

Scrape restaurant data from the EazyDiner website using Python

Clean and preprocess messy, real-world data

Analyze restaurant ratings, pricing, and location trends

Explore relationships between price range and customer ratings

Identify high-performing and low-performing restaurants

Present insights through effective data visualizations

🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset was scraped directly from the EazyDiner website and includes restaurant-level information such as:

Restaurant name

City and location

Cuisine types

Price range / average cost

Customer ratings

Number of reviews

Offers and availability details

Note:
This dataset is created strictly for educational and analytical purposes.

🔍 Analysis Performed

Data cleaning and preprocessing (missing values, duplicates, formatting issues)

City-wise and location-wise restaurant distribution analysis

Rating distribution and customer preference analysis

Price range analysis and segmentation

Relationship analysis between pricing and ratings

Identification of top-rated and low-rated restaurants

📊 Key Insights

Most restaurants fall within a specific rating range, indicating a strong central trend

Higher pricing does not always guarantee higher customer ratings

Certain cities and locations dominate restaurant listings

A small percentage of restaurants receive significantly higher engagement

🛠 Tools & Techniques Used

Python

BeautifulSoup – Web scraping

Requests – HTTP requests

Pandas & NumPy – Data cleaning and manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis and documentation

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how web scraping combined with Exploratory Data Analysis can be used to extract valuable insights from real-world online platforms.
It strengthened my understanding of handling unstructured data, data cleaning techniques, EDA workflows, and data storytelling using visualizations.
